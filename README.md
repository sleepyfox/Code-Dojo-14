Code Dojo 14
============
This is my worked example from the 14th meeting of the London Code Dojo in late Nov 2012. Feel free to play around with it. You will need Node.js installed; you can install other dependencies automatically with:

    npm install

You can run the tests with: 

    npm test

If you would like to automatically run the tests every time you make a change to the test file, then use:
    
    npm run test-auto 

The source of the kata is the Zeckendorf kata, from [rosettacode.org](http://rosettacode.org/)

I've also linked the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/sleepyfox/code-dojo-14-late-nov-2012) from the meeting. You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
