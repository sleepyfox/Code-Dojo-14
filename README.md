Code Dojo 14
============
This is my worked example from the 14th meeting of the London Code Dojo in late Nov 2012. Feel free to play around with it. You can run the code (assuming you have node, coffeescript, mocha and chai installed) with:

    mocha --compilers coffee:coffee-script test-*.coffee

You can install dependencies automatically with:

    npm install

I set up a watchr file (kata.watchr) so that the tests are run automatically every time you save a file in your editor, simply run watchr (assuming it is installed) with:
    
    watchr kata.watchr

The source of the kata is the Zeckendorf kata, from [rosettacode.org](http://rosettacode.org/)

I've also linked the [slides]() from the meeting. You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
